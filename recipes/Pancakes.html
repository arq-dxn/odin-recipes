    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour:</b> Use all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour or a combination of the two. For gluten-free pancakes, use your favourite gluten-free flour bend or try buckwheat flour.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> We use granulated sugar, but other sugars like coconut sugar, raw sugar or brown sugar will work in the recipe.</li>
        <li><b>Salt:</b> We like to use 1/2 teaspoon of fine salt. It balances the sugar nicely and brings out lots of flavour in the pancakes. If you are using salted butter, consider reducing the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.</li>
        <li><b>Milk:</b> Whole milk, reduced-fat and skimmed milk will work in thus recipe. For dairy-free pancakes, substitute non-dairy milk (like unsweetened almond milk or homemade oat milk). I've also used orange juice in place of the milk before and it worked nicely.</li>
        <li><b>Melted butter:</b> You can't beat the taste of butter for this, but if you need a plant-based option, melted coconut oil or melted plant-based butter works too. We use unsalted butter, but salted butter will also work as a substitute.</li>
        <li><b>One Egg:</b> The egg adds structure, flavour and fluffiness. I've shared tips in the frequently asked questions below for making pancakes without eggs. We use a flax egg.</li>
        <li><b>Vanilla Extract:</b> Vanilla adds sweetness and depth of flavor. You could try other extracts too. Almond would be pretty delicious</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk dry ingredients together</li>
        <li>Melt butter and warm milk</li>
        <li>Whisk wet ingredients together</li>
        <li>Combine the dry and wet ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook on a hot buttered skillet</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
        
    </ol>

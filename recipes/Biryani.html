    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies</h4>
            To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron
            in water to prepare saffron water (one teaspoon saffron can be soaked in
            1/4 cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra 
            water. Set them aside for later usage. Now chop the onion and coriander 
            leaves and keep them aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Saute the onions</h4>
            Meanwhile, heat refined oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, 
            add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute 
            for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken 
            into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger garlic paste, red chilli 
            powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Then, add 
            hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and patted dry 
            before adding it to the dish)

        <li>
            <h4>Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes</h4>
            Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander 
            and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. 
            Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now 
            cook the dish without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.
